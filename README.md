# How Profitable are Good Movies?
-----------------------------

## Introduction:

In 1960, there were 2,520 movies released in theaters<sup>1</sup>, mostly to screens in the United States. Reviews came mostly from local and national newspapers and promotional budgets were almost negligible costs. By the turn of the century this number ballooned to 7,830 <sup>2</sup> to the tune of a U.S gross of 10.5 Billion US$ <sup>3</sup>. Reviews now can come from practically anyone and anywhere there is an internet enabled device. This same ubiquity made this study possible.

The main purpose of this project is to use statistical analysis to determine the likelihood of a "Good" movie being "financially successful" <sup>4</sup>.
